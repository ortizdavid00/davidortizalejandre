Portfolio Website Made by David Ortiz-Alejandre

HTML/CSS template website created by html5up.net (@ajlkn)


This portfolio page demonstrates all current projects uploaded on my GitHub repositories. All projects have their active site published through Netlify and have been linked with the portfolio. 

All projects have a static image to show a broad overview, but on hover, there is a GIF that I created for each project that highlights different features for each of the projects.

At the very top of the container for the projects, there is a small navigation bar containing links to my GitHub, my LinkedIn profile, and a Google Form in the case that someone wants to get in contact with me. 

I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio and I will continue to update the website as I build more projects along the way.
